        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The "cha-cha" is a lively and flirtatious Latin dance that originated in Cuba in the early 1950s. <br>
            The dance’s catchy rhythm, consisting of three quick steps followed by a slower step, quickly 
            caught on in Cuba and was eventually introduced to the United States in the early 1950s. <br>
            Its popularity soared after it was shown in Hollywood 
            films and performed in dance competitions. <br>
            The cha-cha’s upbeat tempo and playful, flirtatious movements 
            made it an instant hit, and it became a staple in ballroom dance competitions around the world. <br></p>
